#  Mudra Detection using TensorFlow, OpenCV, and MediaPipe

A real-time hand mudra (gesture) recognition system built with **TensorFlow**, **OpenCV**, and **MediaPipe**.  
This model can identify 73 classical mudras from live webcam video and display the hand angles.

##  Features

- Detects hand landmarks in real-time using MediaPipe Hands.
- Classifies hand mudras into 73 categories using a trained deep learning model (`mudra_model_new.keras`).
- Displays live angles of finger joints for reference.
- Works with any standard webcam.
